# United States Air Quality Analysis üåç

## Description
This project provides **interactive visualizations** for analyzing **air quality trends across the United States**. The analysis focuses on key pollutants from 2000 to 2016, using officially released data from the **United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**.  

### Visualizations Included:

### 1. Choropleth Map:  
- Displays the **average air quality index (AQI)** for different pollutants (NO2, O3, SO2, CO) across all US states.
- Users can **select pollutants** from a dropdown menu.
- **Color gradient** helps quickly identify states with high pollution levels.

### 2. Time Series Line Chart:  
- Shows **daily average pollutant levels** from 2000 to 2016.
- Users can select different pollutants to explore historical trends.
- The x-axis represents time (Date Local), and the y-axis displays pollutant concentrations.

### 3. State-wise Bar Chart:  
- Ranks states based on their **average NO2 levels** over the full time period.
- The bars are **color-coded** to reflect pollution severity (red = high, green = low).
- This chart helps quickly compare air quality across states.
